# 🇨🇺 CubaCell Connect

> The app is named **Cuba-Cell** (with double "L") to avoid any legal conflicts or trademark issues with Cubacel.

An iPhone app to quickly access the **USSD service codes of ETECSA (Cubacel)** : check your balance, buy data/voice/SMS plans, transfer credit and more — all from a clean, organized list that hands the code straight to the system dialer.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

## 🛠️ Requirements

- 🍏 Xcode 15+
- 📱 iOS 17.0+
- ⚙️ [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen) (`brew install xcodegen`)

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/albertolicea00/cubacell-connect.git
cd cubacell-connect
xcodegen generate
open CubaCellConnect.xcodeproj
```

> **Note on XcodeGen:** This project uses **XcodeGen** with a `project.yml` specification to generate `CubaCellConnect.xcodeproj` dynamically and prevent `.pbxproj` merge conflicts.

Build and run on a device. **USSD dialing requires a physical iPhone with a Cubacel SIM** 📲 — the simulator cannot place calls.

To get Caller ID working for `*99` collect calls, after installing the app go to **Ajustes (Settings) › Teléfono › Bloqueo e Identificación de Llamadas** on the device and enable **CallerID**. This is a one-time, manual iOS setting — no app can enable it automatically. See [ARCHITECTURE.md § 11](ARCHITECTURE.md#11-caller-id-extension-99-collect-call-identification) for why.

*The full USSD code catalog is dynamically loaded from our JSON configuration file [`CubaCellConnect/codes.json`](CubaCellConnect/codes.json), keeping the app lightweight and easy to update.* 📁

## ☎️ Direct Dial vs. Confirmation

Free query codes dial immediately. Paid purchase codes stop at ETECSA's confirmation menu by default; an optional **Acción Rápida sin Confirmación** setting enables auto-confirming code variants with a visible UI safety warning.

## 🔍 Directory (Reverse Lookup)

Provides local (user-imported database) and online web search options under Ajustes › Utilidades. For privacy, search is strictly number-only (no name lookup), and results copy to clipboard rather than auto-dialing.

## 🛜 Navigation Rooms & Public Wi-Fi

Includes an offline directory of official ETECSA navigation rooms and public Wi-Fi hotspots by province ([`wifi-rooms-sync-check`](.github/workflows/wifi-rooms-sync-check.yml) action monitors source data drift).

## 🚧 Known Limitations

- **No Siri / Voice Shortcuts integration.** Previously implemented via `AppIntents`, then removed on purpose. Every intent still had to foreground the app and go through the exact same `tel://` dial-confirmation prompt as tapping a code in the UI — so a voice command saved no real steps over unlocking the phone and tapping the code (same trade-off as the widget decision below), while adding a whole extra surface (intents, `AppShortcutsProvider`, a Siri-settings help block) to maintain.

- **Directory database not integrated with Caller ID (`*99`).** The directory database (see above) is intentionally kept separate from `CallerIDStore`/`CallDirectoryHandler` (see [ARCHITECTURE.md § 11](ARCHITECTURE.md#11-caller-id-extension-99-collect-call-identification)), which only ever loads from the device's own Contacts. A CallKit Call Directory Extension has a hard cap on how many identification entries it can register (historically on the order of 100k–200k) — the directory dump has millions of rows (v1: ~4.6M; v2: ~4.8M combined), so registering it wholesale would get the extension rejected/disabled by iOS. Feeding it in would need a drastic filter (e.g. only numbers already in the device's own contacts, which is exactly what happens today) to fit under that ceiling.

- **No "call via WhatsApp/Teams" option in Contactos.** The Contactos tab only offers cellular actions (normal call, `*99` collect, `#31#` anonymous) next to each contact — it can't add a "call via WhatsApp" or "call via Teams" option alongside them. Those apps place calls over their own proprietary VoIP/Wi-Fi-calling stack, not the cellular network, and don't expose any public API or URL scheme a third-party app can use to trigger a call through them — that's entirely up to WhatsApp/Teams themselves (they'd need to register their own CallKit provider and/or an app-specific integration), not something CubaCellConnect can add from the outside.

- **iOS security sandbox and USSD limitations (no real-time balance tracking).** Unlike Android (where apps can intercept USSD responses in the background), iOS sandbox security prevents third-party apps from reading or parsing USSD response dialogs, chaining sessions automatically, or running background USSD queries. Because of this system limitation, the app cannot automatically display or update your balance, data packages, or bonus balances in real-time inside the app UI; dialing a code (`tel://`) hands off execution to the native Phone app where the user sees the carrier response screen directly.

- **No Home Screen widget.** Considered and deliberately not built. A WidgetKit extension cannot call `UIApplication.shared.open`/`tel://` at all — `APPLICATION_EXTENSION_API_ONLY` makes that API unavailable in any app extension, widgets included, so a widget can never dial a code or place a `*99`/`#31#` call by itself. The only thing a widget *could* do is open the app via a deep link and let the app dial from there — but that adds a screen transition on top of what unlocking the phone and tapping the app icon already does, with no code actually reaching the dialer any faster. Not worth the extra target, App Group, and maintenance surface for zero real shortcut.

- **Physical dual-SIM (two nano-SIM) devices.** iPhone models sold in mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macao support two physical nano-SIMs, instead of the nano-SIM + eSIM combo sold everywhere else. This app has no line-selection UI and no way to force a dial through one SIM specifically — iOS gives apps no public API to pick which line places a `tel://`/USSD call; it always goes out through whichever line the device's own Phone settings mark as default. Acknowledged, not implemented.

- **No iPad / iPadOS support for USSD.** Even though Cellular iPad models exist (with physical SIM or eSIM slots), Apple completely blocks USSD code execution on iPadOS. iPadOS lacks a full Phone dialer application, which means users cannot dial USSD codes (such as `*222#`, `*133#`, or `*234#`), trigger `tel://*222%23` URLs from third-party apps, or receive USSD network responses.

- **No Apple Watch / watchOS support for USSD.** Similarly, Cellular Apple Watch models do not support USSD code execution or third-party USSD dialing via watchOS.
