An iPhone app to quickly access the **USSD service codes of ETECSA (Cubacel)** : check your balance, buy data/voice/SMS plans, transfer credit and more — all from a clean, organized list that hands the code straight to the system dialer.


## ✨ Features

- 📋 **Full USSD catalog** grouped by category: Balance & Plans, Purchases & Top-Up, Transfers, and Other Utilities.
- 📞 **One-tap dialing** — the app opens the system dialer with the code prefilled (`#` correctly percent-encoded).
- ⌨️ **Input-aware codes** — codes like `*662*{card}#` or `#31#{number}` ask for the missing part before dialing.
- 📎 **Copy to clipboard** for any code.
- 💡 **Mnemonics** — e.g. `328 = DAT`, `266 = BON`, `869 = VOZ` — the keypad letters spell the service name.
- 🌗 **Light and dark mode** support.

*The full USSD code catalog is dynamically loaded from our JSON configuration file [`CubacellConnect/Resources/ussd_codes.json`](CubacellConnect/Resources/ussd_codes.json), keeping the app lightweight and easy to update.* 📁

## 🛠️ Requirements

- 🍏 Xcode 15+
- 📱 iOS 17.0+
- ⚙️ [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen) (`brew install xcodegen`)

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/albertolicea00/cubacell-connect.git
cd cubacell-connect
xcodegen generate
open CubacellConnect.xcodeproj
```

Build and run on a device. **USSD dialing requires a physical iPhone with a Cubacel SIM** 📲 — the simulator cannot place calls.

## 🔄 Code source of truth

The USSD codes in [`CubacellConnect/Resources/ussd_codes.json`](CubacellConnect/Resources/ussd_codes.json) mirror the canonical [`cuba-cubacel`](https://github.com/albertolicea00/MyUSSDCodes-collection/blob/main/codes/cuba-cubacel.json) collection in **[MyUSSDCodes-collection](https://github.com/albertolicea00/MyUSSDCodes-collection)** — the single source of truth for USSD codes across all my apps.

A weekly GitHub Action ([`ussd-sync-check`](.github/workflows/ussd-sync-check.yml)) compares the dial strings shipped here against that collection. On drift the run fails and opens a `ussd-sync` issue listing the added/removed codes. **Fix codes upstream in MyUSSDCodes-collection first, then sync this file to match.**
